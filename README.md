# ten fingers

A tool for people with diabetes to track which fingers were pricked recently.

A web remake of the [unfinished android version](https://github.com/heatherbooker/DiabetesBuddy).

## Usage:

After you prick a finger for a blood sample, click that finger. The page will remember which day you clicked which finger, and show how many days it has been since you last clicked that finger.

This is a website. If you want it to look like an app on your phone, search "add website shortcut to phone home screen", and look for an article like [this one for iphone](https://www.howtogeek.com/667910/how-to-add-a-website-to-your-iphone-or-ipad-home-screen/) or [this one for android](https://www.howtogeek.com/667938/how-to-add-a-website-to-your-android-home-screen/).
